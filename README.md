## Project info
This is simple live radio transcoder server for **Euro Truck Simulator 2 / American Truck Simulator** games.

As you may know internet radio player in these games does not support anything but plain MP3 stream.
But there are lots of internet radios novadays that use AAC / AAC+ codecs or HLS for streaming. Of course, you can play
such radios in your favourite player just in the background but this is not so easy to do on devices like Steam Deck.

So this is probably the main reason you would use this project for.
You can run this script on your own VPS or (if you don't have it) even directly on your Steam Deck (I don't know why but 
SD surprisingly has everything to run it out of the box).

## Requirements
- python 3
- ffmpeg

## Stations file
Before usage, you should also modify **stations.json** file from the repo. It's a simple JSON file which holds all the 
stations you need to be transcoded. Format is very simple and self-explanatory:

`	{
		"radio1": {
			"name": "Record Innocence",
			"url": "https://radiorecord.hostingradio.ru/ibiza96.aacp",
			"bitrate": 128
		},
		"radio2": {
			"name": "Record Mix",
			"url": "https://radiorecord.hostingradio.ru/mix96.aacp",
			"bitrate": 128
		}
	}`

According to this example corresponding radios should be added to your **live_streams.sii** ATS/ETS file with following URLs:
- `http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/radio1` for "Record Innocence" station 
- `http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT/radio2` for "Record Mix" station

Output bitrate of MP3 streams will be 128 kbit/s.
You should replace **IP_ADDRESS** with real IP address of your VPS or in case you run it directly on steam deck with just
**localhost**. Replace **PORT** with port on which you run server.

## Running the server on SD
`$ ./server.py --port 48042`

## Running the server on VPS
`$ ./server.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 48042`

If you want to automatically start the service on system boot - modify the **etsradiotc.service** and add it to systemd autostart:
`	$ sudo cp etsradiotc.service /etc/systemd/system/
	$ sudo systemctl enable --now etsradiotc.service`
